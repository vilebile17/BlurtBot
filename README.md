# BlurtBot

BlurtBot is a simple (and useless) discord bot developed for a [boot.dev personal project](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-personal-project-1).

## Commands
* !predict · predicts the next message using 20 messages of context through Google Gemini.
* !message-counter · counts the number of messages that each user sent in the channel that the command is used in
* !bookbot · based on my first [boot.dev project](https://github.com/vilebile17/bookbot), it finds the count of each character in the channel (That includes use of emojis)
* !8ball · pretty self explanatory, acts like a magic-8-ball
* @BlurtBot · not technically a command, but what it does is it sends that message to gemini which then gives a response. It's basically having google gemini built directly into the discord channel if you ever wish to use it
